React Native `<Image>` component, that rescales itselfs correctly on iOS and Android devices.

##Why?

React Native's Image size is rendered the same regardless of device size and resolution.
Desired behaviour in is to have a component, that scales appropriately.

##Installation

`npm install react-native-responsive-image --save`


##Usage


Use the `<ResponsiveImage>` component and set it's `initWidth` and `initHeight` props.

These values are used as they are for iPhone6 Plus, and they are scaled down on any smaller iOS/Android device.


##Example

Three images in one full-width row:

```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { AppRegistry, StyleSheet, View } from 'react-native';
import ResponsiveImage from 'react-native-responsive-image';

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <View style={{flex: 1, justifyContent: 'center',}}>
                <View style={{flexDirection: 'row',}}>
                    <ResponsiveImage source={{uri: 'https://facebook.github.io/react/img/logo_og.png'}} initWidth="138" initHeight="138"/>
                    <ResponsiveImage source={{uri: 'https://facebook.github.io/react/img/logo_og.png'}} initWidth="138" initHeight="138"/>
                    <ResponsiveImage source={{uri: 'https://facebook.github.io/react/img/logo_og.png'}} initWidth="138" initHeight="138"/>
                </View>
            </View>
    );
  }
}

AppRegistry.registerComponent('ResponsiveImageExample', () => App);
```

##One image size?

We could have added support for multiple image sources, like [https://github.com/exponentjs/react-native-responsive-image]([https://github.com/exponentjs/react-native-responsive-image]) has.
It sounds like you would save some bytes by delivering less-resolution images to devices with lower resolution.

But solution that worked the best for me was different. Actually you need to serve just one high-resolution compressed, and it will even save more bytes. Though @2x or @3x images have more pixels, itâ€™s surprising how much they can be compressed.

##A static image to display while loading the image source?
```javascript
<ResponsiveImage
  source={{uri: 'https://facebook.github.io/react/img/logo_og.png'}} initWidth="138" initHeight="138"
  defaultSource={require('placeholder.png')} />
```

##Example project

###Create project

`react-native init ResponsiveImageExample`

`cp ./example/index.android.js ./ResponsiveImageExample/index.android.js`

`cp ./example/index.ios.js ./ResponsiveImageExample/index.ios.js`

`cd ResponsiveImageExample`

`npm i react-native-responsive-image`


###Run on iOS

Open ResponsiveImageExample/ios/ResponsiveImageExample.xcodeproj

Run the project inside iOS Simulator simulator

###Run on Android

Go to ResponsiveImageExample

`react-native run-android`

##Development

To propagate changes from the component package to example project: 

1. run 'npm link' in the root directory.

2. go to '/ResponsiveImageExample' and run 'npm link react-native-responsive-images'

This will create symlink for the package, so now you can import from 'react-native-responsive-image'
